Android Chatbot Application README

This README file provides an overview and instructions for the Android chatbot application developed in Java. The app incorporates OpenAI and DALL路E 2 models, allowing it to generate conversational responses and display images based on user input. The Volley library is used to handle API calls.
App Description

The Android chatbot application is designed to provide users with an interactive conversational experience. By entering text prompts or descriptions, users can engage in conversations with the OpenAI model and receive AI-generated responses. Additionally, users can request images by providing descriptions, and the app will display images generated by the DALL路E 2 model. The app utilizes the Volley library for handling API calls and network communication.
Prerequisites

    Android Studio (version Android Studio Electric Eel | 2022.1.1 Patch 2)
    Android SDK (version 33.0.2)
    OpenAI API Key (Visit the OpenAI website to obtain your API key)

Getting Started

    Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/kamalvankam/ASKAI.git

    Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
    Navigate to the cloned project and select the project's root folder.
    Wait for the project to sync with the Gradle files and ensure there are no errors.

Configuration

    Open the Constants.java file located in the app/src/main/java/com/yourapp/utils directory.
    Find the OPENAI_API_KEY constant and replace the placeholder value with your OpenAI API key.

Dependencies

The app utilizes the following dependencies, which are defined in the build.gradle file:

    Volley (for network requests)
    Gson (for JSON parsing)

Ensure that you have an active internet connection during the build process to download these dependencies.
Usage

    Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
    To request a response:
    On the app's main screen, enter a prompt or description to initiate a conversation with the OpenAI model.
    Tap the "Send" button to send the message to the OpenAI model.
    Wait for the response from the server. Once received, the AI-generated reply will be displayed on the screen.
    To request an image:
        Type "Generate image" of [Enter a description for the image you want to generate.].
        Tap the "Send" button to send the request to the DALL路E 2 model.
        Wait for the response from the server. Once received, the generated image will be displayed on the screen.
    To continue the conversation or generate additional images, repeat steps 2-5.

Troubleshooting

    If you encounter any issues during the build process, ensure that your Android Studio and SDK versions are compatible with the project.
    If you receive errors related to the OpenAI API key, make sure you have correctly replaced the placeholder value in the Constants.java file.
    If the app fails to communicate with the server, check your internet connection and ensure that the OpenAI and DALL路E 2 APIs are accessible.
